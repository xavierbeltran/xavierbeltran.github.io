# Portfolio Project
- **Note:** Both versions of the [portfolio](https://www.github.com/xavierbeltran/3d-portfolio) are nowhere near a final form. Please add any bugs or issues notices in the issues tab please. 
- Using GitHub Pages and Jekyll to allow for multiple pages.
- Using Bootstrap, HTML, and JavaScript to build a very simple "first version" of a personal portfolio
- Added some features with particle.js and CSS.
