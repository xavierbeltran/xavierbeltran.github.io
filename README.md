# Portfolio Project
- **Note:*** Both versions of the [portfolio](https://www.github.com/xavierbeltran/3d-portfolio) have bugs and need adequate testing. Any issues that are not already in the issues, please add so that I am aware of the bugs. 
- Using GitHub Pages and Jekyll to allow for multiple pages.
- Using Bootstrap, HTML, and JavaScript to build a very simple "first version" of a personal portfolio
- Added some features with particle.js and CSS.
